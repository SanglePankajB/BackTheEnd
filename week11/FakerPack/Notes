1st of all -->  To use faker you need to install faker as  npm install @faker-js/faker --save-dev 
                not like npm i faker --> it gives problems while importing


You dont need to initialize node project to do use faker



You import it only like  -> const { faker } = require('@faker-js/faker');   otherwise give errors

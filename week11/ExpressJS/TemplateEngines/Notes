You have to follow the dir structure for working with template engines
You need to have your .hbs files in views
But
if you want to change the default name views dir you can do it with app.set('views', 'newpath') this way see index.js file for more

IMP : whenever we are working with template engines rather than res.send() we have to write res.render()
---> app.get('/', (req, res) =>{
    res.render('index')
})

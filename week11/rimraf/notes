It is not package to use in js file
it is commandline packae that is alternative for rm command
It deletes files recursively

For that :
YOu have to download it as the global package  npm i -g rimraf

now you can delete files and directories in your project

In curr folder I create 
                1. filetodel --> file
                2. dirtodel --> folder
                which i deleted using terminal commands:
                    1. rimraf ./filetodel
                    2. rimraf ./dirtodel

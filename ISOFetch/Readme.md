 it refers to the practice of using the standard fetch API in a way that works consistently across different JavaScript environments, such as browsers and Node.js.

In modern JavaScript, the fetch API is available in web browsers for making HTTP requests. However, Node.js does not have this API built-in. To make HTTP requests in Node.js, you typically use the http or https modules or third-party libraries like axios.

The term "isomorphic fetch" comes from the idea of writing code that can be used both on the client-side (in web browsers) and the server-side (in Node.js) without modification. This practice is often called "universal JavaScript" or "isomorphic JavaScript."

To achieve isomorphic fetch, developers can use various strategies:

Use a Polyfill: You can use a polyfill like node-fetch in Node.js to provide a fetch function that is compatible with the browser's fetch. This way, you can write code that uses fetch and it will work in both environments.

Conditional Imports: You can conditionally import the appropriate HTTP request library based on the environment. For example, you might use fetch in the browser and a library like axios in Node.js.



Dynamic imports are a feature in JavaScript that allow you to load modules or code dynamically at runtime, instead of importing them all at the beginning of a script. They are introduced through the import() function, which returns a Promise that resolves to the imported module.
